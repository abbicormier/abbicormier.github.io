I am a fifth-year economics PhD candidate in the John Munro Godfrey, Sr. Department of Economics in the Terry College of Business at the University of Georgia.

My [research](/research/) lies at the intersection of health and labor economics. In my dissertation, I examine how health shocks and disruptions in healthcare access affect individuals, families, and communities. I employ quasi-experimental methods to identify causal effects on health and economic outcomes.

My job market paper examines the causal impact of having a first-born child with special needs on parental labor market outcomes and subsequent family formation in the United States.
